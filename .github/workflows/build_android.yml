          mkdir -p .gradle/wrapper/dists/gradle-8.1.4-bin/
          
          # 2. 🔥 CRITICAL FIX: gradlew.jar file ko download karo aur unzip karo
          GRADLE_VERSION="8.1.4"
          GRADLE_ZIP="gradle-${GRADLE_VERSION}-bin.zip"
          
          curl -L "https://services.gradle.org/distributions/${GRADLE_ZIP}" -o gradle.zip
          unzip gradle.zip
          
          # 3. Directly call the Gradle wrapper JAR file with safe JVM arguments
          export JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx3072m"
          
          # Call the main class inside the downloaded JAR
          java $JAVA_OPTS -classpath "gradle-${GRADLE_VERSION}/lib/gradle-launcher-${GRADLE_VERSION}.jar" org.gradle.launcher.GradleMain assembleRelease -Pflutter.buildMode=release -Pflutter.target=lib/main.dart
